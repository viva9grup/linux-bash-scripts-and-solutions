When you install Composer, the Laravel global installer is 
not installed by default. Even if you install it using the 
first command mentioned below, it will not work. You need to 
add the command to the path using the second command mentioned. 
After that, you will be able to use the Laravel installer.

$ composer global require "laravel/installer"
$ export PATH="~/.config/composer/vendor/bin:$PATH"
$ laravel new your_project_name
